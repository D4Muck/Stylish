# Stylish
A magical library for styling your app, with the ability to apply and see the results of styles while editing your storyboards

## Installation
- Download the file `Stylish.swift` from the Source folder in this repo and add it to your project.  
- (Optional but recommended) add a key called “Theme” to your app’s info.plist. The value of this key will tell Stylish which Theme class to load by default

## Example Project
To see Stylish in action, download the sample project and open in the latest version of Xcode. Change the value for the “Theme” key in the info.plist to be “Aqua” instead of “Graphite” and then open the Main storyboard.  Watch as the styles change right before your eyes.
